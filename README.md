# universalizer

The KG-Hub Universalizer provides functions for knowledge graph cleanup and identifier normalization.

## Installation

Install with `pip`:

```
pip install universalizer
```

OR

Install with Poetry.

```
git clone https://github.com/Knowledge-Graph-Hub/universalizer.git
cd universalizer
poetry install
```

## Usage

With KGX format node and edge files in the same directory:

```
universalizer run path/to/directory
```

Or, if they're in a single tar.gz file:

```
universalizer run -c graph.tar.gz
```

### ID and category mapping

SSSOM-format maps are supported. Use a single map file:

```
univeralizer run -m poro-mp-exact-1.0.sssom.tsv path/to/directory
```

or a whole directory of them:

```
univeralizer run -m path/to/mapfiles path/to/directory
```

For SSSOM maps from `subject_id` to `object_id`, subject node IDs will be remapped to object IDs.

If the `object_category` value is specified the node's category ID will be remapped as well.

Note that this will complete node normalization *and* ID remapping.

Maps should use the normalized form (e.g., specify "FBbt:00005201", not "FBBT:00005201", even if the latter form is in the input graph.)
